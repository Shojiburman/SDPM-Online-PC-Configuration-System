Personal computers are used all over the world for different purposes and there are more than a billion computers in use currently. Even in our country, the use of personal computers has increased rapidly in the recent years. But building a personal computer is still very stressful. Choosing the right products from a large number of options can be very difficult. There are many companies that provide a wide range of products of different capabilities in different price range. So building the best suited system according to the need and within budget is the primary focus of the customers. But there are no platforms where the customers can view different products of distinct capabilities and compare among those products in terms of the brand or price. Availability of the products is another major concern in this regard. Our system looks to address this situation and tries to provide a solution to this problem
